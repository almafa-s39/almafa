# RRAS Server - RAVPN (Certificate)

Remote access VPN server with RRAS Server and Strongswan Client with Certificate authentication

## 1. Information

The tunnel will be established between a Debian and a Windows host. Both share the network `200.0.0.0/24`, and the Windows Server also has their own network.

- Debian shared: `200.0.0.2`
- Windows shared: `200.0.0.1`
- Windows private: `10.0.0.103/24`

## 2. Server setup

### 2.1 Directory

In **Active Directory Users and Computers**, create a user **Security Group** called *VPN Users*. This group will hold the users you want to have remote access. Add a user to the group.

### 2.2 Certificate setup

Two certificate templates will be needed for this guide. One for the **server**, and one for **user authentication**.

Open **Certification Authority**, click on **Certificate Templates** > **Manage**. Copy a server certificate (e.g. Web Server), name it *VPN Server*, and make sure it has **Server Authentication** and **IPSec IKE intermediate** EKUs (Application policies).

Copy the **User** template:

- Name it *VPN User*
- Raise CA and recipient compatibility level to **Windows Server 2016/Windows 10**
- Uncheck **Publish certificate in Active Directory**
- In **Security**, remove **Domain Users**
- Add the **VPN Users** group, set permission to **Read, Enroll, Autoenroll**
- In **Subject Name**, uncheck **Include e-mail name in subject name** and **E-mail name**

Create a certificate for the VPN server. For the subject name, the guide will use `C=DK, O=LEGO, CN=srv-win.test.dk`. For alternate names

- `DNS:srv-win.test.dk`,
- `DNS:200.0.0.1` and
- `IP4:200.0.0.1`

will be used. After creating the request, submit it, then install the certificate in the **Local Machine Personal** store.

Open the **Local User** certificate manager, and create a custom request using the **VPN User** template. After submitting the request, install it in the **Local User Personal** store, then export it. Include private key, and encrypt it with a password.

Copy the resulting **pfx** file to the client using `scp`.

> [!NOTE]
> If the client doesn't already have it, also copy the CA certificate.

### 2.3 Network Policy Server

Install the **Network Policy and Access Services** role to the server. After installation, open **Network Policy Server** console. Right click on **NPS (Local)**, and select *Register server in Active Directory*.

In the **Getting Started** section, select **Configure VPN or Dial-Up**. In the wizard:

- Select **Virtal Private Network (VPN) Connections**, then click **Next**.
- For clients, add localhost with IP address `127.0.0.1` (or any remote client).
- In **Authentication Methods**, uncheck *MS-CHAPv2* and select *EAP*. Set type to *Microsoft: Smart Card or other certificate*. Click on **Configure** and select the previously created **VPN Server certificate**.
- Select the **VPN Users** group.
- For **IP Filters, Encryption Settings** and **Realm Name**, leave everything as **default**, then finish the wizard.

### 2.4 Remote Access Server

Install the **Remote Access** role with **DirectAccess and VPN (RAS)** feature. In the configuration window, select **Deploy VPN only**.

Open the **Routing and Remote Access** management console, and select **Configure Routing and Remote Access**. Select **Custom configuration**, then check at least **VPN access**.

After setup, right click on **Ports** and select **Properties**. In **SSTP, L2TP, PPTP** and **PPPoE**, uncheck everything, so only IKEv2 and GRE are left.

By right-clicking on **Servername (local)**, open **Properties**:

- In **Security** tab, open **Authentication methods** and make sure only **EAP**, **MSChapv2** and **IKEv2** are selected.
- In **IPv4**, select **Static address** pool, and create a pool, for example `192.0.2.1-254`.

Your server is now ready to accept connections.
